  <p>Hey there, I'm Chuck Ha. I'm a technical consultant. I work with businesses to find solutions to their technical challenges.</p>
  <p>I take the time to understand the needs and requirements of the business and make sure my clients end up with a piece of software that works well and is easy to use.</p>
  <p>In the past, I worked at the <a class="standout" href="http://mbl.edu">Marine Biological Laboratory</a> where I helped scientists develop solutions to their technological problems. Often, this involved accessing and manipulating a lot of data via a web app. I also worked as a software engineer at an epub startup that got acquired by <a class="standout" href="http://safaribooksonline.com">Safari Books Online</a>.
  <p>I'm based in Brooklyn, NY but work with people from coast to coast. Feel free to get in touch at <span class="mono">ha.ch<span class="ob">notreal</span>uck@<span>gmai</span>l.com</span></p>
