Hi! I'm Chuck. I work at [Heptio][1] where I [build][sonobuoy] [products][2] for Kubernetes users and operators and work on [Kubernetes itself][commits]. I write a lot of [Go][3] and I occasionally dabble in various JavaScript frameworks. I've worked at a number of places including [Etsy][4], but you can find all that out on my [linkedin][5].

I write infrastructure and application code for my side project, [zerosixzero][z6z].
