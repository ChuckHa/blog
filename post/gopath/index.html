<h1>Using $GOPATH effectively.</h1>
<hr />
<p>Using <code>$GOPATH</code> effectively can be confusing at first. If you follow guides on <a href="http://golang.org">golang.org</a> you&rsquo;ll
end up with way too many packages and dependency confusion in <code>$HOME/go/src</code>. This is the
exact same problem new Python developers have before someone tells them about <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>. You end up
making a mess out of the system Python and use <code>sudo easy_install</code> way too much.</p>

<p>However, we can ignore some of the fancy features that virtualenv provides. For instance, it
doesn&rsquo;t usually make sense to have different versions for Go unless you&rsquo;re working on the
language itself, in which case you probably know what you&rsquo;re doing. All we really care about
is having <code>go install</code> put packages in the right place and not clobber or clutter anything.</p>

<p>Since all we are doing is modifying the environment to get a new Go workspace, I wrote a
<a href="https://github.com/chuckha/goenv">simple bash script</a> that does this for you. It creates the necessary directories for a Go
workspace (<code>pkg</code>, <code>src</code>, <code>bin</code>), modifies the <code>$GOPATH</code> and <code>$PATH</code> variables and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>There are two versions, one spawns a subshell with these updated variables, found on the branch
<a href="https://github.com/chuckha/goenv/tree/inve">inve</a> based on a gist about how <a href="https://gist.github.com/datagrok/2199506">virtualenv is doing it wrong</a> and one that I find a bit
more pleasant to use that you have to <code>source</code> and modify the current shell environment.</p>
