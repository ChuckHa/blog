<p>I worked with the <a href="http://thehpalliance.org/">Harry Potter Alliance</a> to implement their vision of
a website to help spread their message. I worked closely with their designer
to get a working product that fulfilled their requirements. We discussed what
exactly they wanted out of this product and I translated their needs into
a site that was tailored specifically to them.</p>

<p>The part that you don&rsquo;t see in the screen shots is the admin section. This
was the most complicated piece of the application. Admins could verify that
images were appropriate to be displayed on the front page. They were also
able to delete images based off of a URL and generate CSV reports of users
that had submitted content to the site.</p>

<p>This website was written entirely in <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> and uses <a href="http://mongodb.org/">mongodb</a> for a
data store. The image processing is a custom thumbnail library I built and
plan to release as an open source project.</p>

<p>At its peak, this site received almost 200,000 hits in a 12 hour period.
Nothing huge, but that load will make any mistakes in the code very obvious.
At first, the server was holding onto too many connections, but once I fixed
that bug, there has been no downtime since. Average response times are about
50ms and time to DOMLoaded (on my machine) is about 300ms.</p>
